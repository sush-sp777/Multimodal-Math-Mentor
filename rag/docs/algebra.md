# Algebra – Core Formulas & Techniques (JEE Level)

## Linear Equations
- Single variable: ax + b = 0 → x = -b / a
- Two variables:
  ax + by = c  
  dx + ey = f  
  Solve using substitution or elimination.

## Quadratic Equations
Standard form:
ax² + bx + c = 0

Roots:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

Discriminant (D = b² - 4ac):
- D > 0 → two distinct real roots
- D = 0 → equal roots
- D < 0 → complex roots

## Relations Between Roots
If roots are α and β:
- α + β = -b / a
- αβ = c / a

## Inequalities
- Solve like equations, but **reverse sign when multiplying/dividing by negative**
- For quadratic inequalities:
  1. Find roots
  2. Draw number line
  3. Check sign in intervals

## Modulus
|x| = a ⇒ x = ±a (a ≥ 0)

|x| < a ⇒ -a < x < a  
|x| > a ⇒ x > a or x < -a

## Common Tricks
- Complete the square
- Factorization before applying formula
- Check domain when square roots or denominators exist
