# Calculus – Derivatives (JEE Basics)

## Definition
Derivative of f(x):
f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

## Standard Derivatives
d/dx (xⁿ) = n·xⁿ⁻¹  
d/dx (sin x) = cos x  
d/dx (cos x) = -sin x  
d/dx (eˣ) = eˣ  
d/dx (ln x) = 1/x  

## Rules
Sum rule:
d/dx (f + g) = f' + g'

Product rule:
(fg)' = f'g + fg'

Quotient rule:
(f/g)' = (f'g - fg') / g²

Chain rule:
dy/dx = dy/du × du/dx

## Applications
- Increasing function: f'(x) > 0
- Decreasing function: f'(x) < 0
- Max/Min: f'(x) = 0 and check second derivative

## Common Errors
- Missing chain rule
- Wrong sign in trigonometric derivatives
- Ignoring domain (e.g., ln x, √x)
