# Probability – Concepts & Solving Techniques

## Basic Definitions
Probability of event A:
P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes)

0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1

## Complementary Event
P(A') = 1 - P(A)

## Addition Rule
For two events A and B:
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

## Conditional Probability
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(B) ≠ 0

## Independent Events
A and B are independent if:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

## Bayes' Theorem
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)

## Common Question Types
- Coins & dice
- Cards
- Urn problems
- At least one success
- Exactly k successes

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting total sample space
- Mixing independent and dependent cases
- Not using complement when easier
